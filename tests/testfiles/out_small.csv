They both performed important studies in mathematics and astronomy (thus, Delmedigo had the chance to use Galileo's telescope in Padua). They both supported the Copernican Revolution, in spite of the dangerous reactions this could challenge.

He was also interested in the axiomatization of those parts of physics in which mathematics plays a role, as this was the substance of his sixth problem delivered to the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900. The paper under review presents an account of some aspects of Hilbert's work in this area of physics during the early years of the 20th century. 


Hilbert's main activity in pure mathematics in the first decade of the 20th century was the theory of integral equations. He was able to use the techniques he developed there to provide more secure mathematical foundations for both the kinetic theory of gases and radiation theory, two topics on which he lectured and wrote between 1911 and 1914. He had a noteworthy success in this respect in his asymptotic solution to the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation of the kinetic theory. In addition to providing lecture courses at Göttingen, Hilbert also organized seminars on physical questions, attended by such notables as Erich Hecke, Max Born and Theodor von Kármán. Hilbert's approach to providing a rigorous foundation for physics did not meet with universal approval from the physicists, and Hilbert was forced to modify his methods to take into account objections raised by Ernst Pringsheim. Equally, Hermann Weyl felt that Hilbert's achievements in this area could hardly compare with his work in pure mathematics. 


The reviewed paper is well written and provides a good introduction to this less familiar aspect of Hilbert's multi-faceted oeuvre.","['01A55', '01A60', '01A60', '83-03', '01A60', '01A55', '51-03']"

These integral equations are only weakly singular, and their validity requires only that the boundary displacement data are continuous, hence, allowing standard \(C^0\) elements to be employed. As part of the numerical implementation, a special crack-tip element is developed which has a feature in that there exist degrees of freedom associated with the nodes at the crack front.","['74R05', '74S05', '74C99', '74-01', '74S15', '74-04', '65N38', '65R20', '74R05', '74S30', '65R20', '74-02', '65N38', '26A42', '35J25', '74S15', '74R99', '74S15', '74R99', '45E99', '74S15', '74R05', '74B99', '74H99', '74R05', '74R05', '74S30', '65R20', '74E10', '74S15', '74B99', '74R99', '74B05', '74B10', '74S15', '74S15', '74B10', '74R05', '65R20', '74S05', '45E05', '65N35', '65N30', '35J05', '35C15', '74S30', '65R20', '65R20', '65N35', '74B99', '74C99', '45E05', '74R05', '74S05', '65N06', '74S05', '74R05', '74S30', '65N25', '65N22', '74R05', '74S30', '65R20', '74S99', '74G70', '74S05', '74S30', '74P10', '74R99', '74A60', '74M25']"

In this process, a total of six implicitness parameters characteristic of the current flowfield are introduced. They are calculated from the current flowfield or changes of Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers, Peclet numbers, and Damköhler numbers (if reacting) at each nodal point and time step. This implies that every nodal point or element is provided with different or unique numerical scheme according to their current flowfield situations, whether compressible, incompressible, viscous, inviscid, laminar, turbulent, reacting, or nonreacting. In this procedure, discontinuities or fluctuations of all variables between adjacent nodal points are determined accurately. If these implicitness parameters are fixed to certain numbers instead of being calculated from the flowfield information, then practically all currently available schemes for finite differences or finite elements arise as special cases. Some benchmark problems are presented in order to show the validity, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed methodology.","['76G25', '76J20', '65Z05', '65M06', '65M12', '35L65', '76D05', '76W05', '76J20', '65-02', '65N06', '76-02', '76-04', '65N30', '65Z05', '74S05', '76M10', '65N30', '74S30', '74P10', '76N10', '80A20', '76M10', '76K05', '76M10', '76N10', '76D05', '76B47', '76M10', '76M25', '76F10', '76N10', '76D05']"

The present article offers a new approach based on projection operators permitting a detailed analysis of the Dirac equation with electromagnetic potential. It offers decomposition of the operator: 
\[
D+fI=P^+ D_{\xi^+} +P^-D_{\xi-},
\]
 where \(P^+= 1/(2\gamma) (\gamma + f^\to)I\), \(\gamma= [\{f^\to\}^2]^{1/2}\), where any root can be taken, and \(P^-=1/(2\gamma) (\gamma-f^\to)I\). This allows the author to establish an inverse relation, basically solving certain classes of problems.
