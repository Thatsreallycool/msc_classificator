title: new msc classificator
subtitle: development update

structure:
    1. introduction
        - predicting msc codes, currently works based on reference msc with low
         accuracy
         - 63 2-digit
         - 529 3-digit
         - 6006 5-digit
         -> IMAGE figure1 paper
        - challenges
            - sparsely populated
            - multi-label
    2. msc codes need classification - goals
        - develop method for 5-digit classification using keyword or abstract
        text
        - compare to actual truth vs human base line and reference
        classification
        - evaluation metrics for improvement of methods
        -> IMAGE half figure 2 from paper
    3. graph between keywords and msc codes, counting how often
        - linear mapping (graph/map)
        - source es1.get_all_documents({de:(msc,kw)}
        -> IMAGE my own graph?
    4. division into modules
        - create/update training module
        - classification
        - evaluation (for further dev, not for production)
        -> IMAGE modules feed into each other
    5. details:
        - lemmatization,
        - stopwords,
        - long tail of rare events(cutoff)
    6. current state:
        - library done,
        - PS: old training data dump -> ES
        - working on api
        - entity linking
    7. metrics for improvement:
        - current:
            + precision, recall
            + ranking
        - needed (asking audience) prediction counting:
            + perfect match (correct msc codes in correct order)
            + imperfect match (correct msc codes not in order)
            + missing (1 or more missing but no wrong msc) - quality?
            + FP (1 or more wrong msc)
            + no correct predictions

    8. improvement plans:
        - currently cutoff by length, now cutoff by scoring
        - not only keywords, but text phrases, reference msc as (lower)
        weighting
        - full bayes, including expert knowledge as prior information
        - hyper weightings for types of documents
        - other parts of document data (suggestions from audience are welcome)
        - learning from corrections of human
        - distinction types of documents
